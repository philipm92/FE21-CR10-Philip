Requirements

Task: As a Full Stack Web Developer you got your first full-stack project, the Big Library web application. The customer wants you to create a big list of all media available in the library (books, CDs, DVDs) and make it available over the web.


The information that you will need to have in your DataBase is:
Consider them as columns for the table:
- title, image (HTTP link to an image*), ISBN code, short_description, type (book, CD, DVD), author_ first_name, author_last_name, publisher_ name, publisher_address, publish_date.
- Additionally, status (“available” or “reserved”)  required for Bonus Points.
- file uploader as in prework

- Add test data: at least 10 entries 
- Display List of Media: Fetch the media data from your database and display it on the browser.
- User-Friendly GUI: Create web-pages with a nice design using the Bootstrap framework or just HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- Insert form for Media: Create an inserting form for Media. A user should be able to insert data into the database over the front-end form.
- Update form for Media: Create a form for updating Media.
- Delete Media: A user should be able to delete Media from the database by clicking on the Delete button.

Bonus Points:
- You should create a button - "show media", that will be displayed together with every Media shown on the list. Once that button is clicked, all details regarding that specific Media (title, author, ISBN, short_description, and status (available or reserved) will be displayed on a new web page.
(hint: take a closer look on the edit page, it may inspire you to do this task)

- Create a list of Publishers. When you click on a Publisher name, a user should be able to see the list of Media that “belong” to this specific Publisher.
